# Reverse mode speaker based audio event classifier
This repository contains the source code for the paper: Analysis and utilization of reverse mode loudspeakers

The neural network structure is borrowed from:
https://github.com/douglas125/SpeechCmdRecognition

The claps were recorded by reverse mode speaker with 2" cone diameter, resonance frequency = 270 Hz.

Note: The selected classes from the UrbanSound8k dataset cannot be uploaded here, but the dataset is available at:
